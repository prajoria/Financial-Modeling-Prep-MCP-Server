## Release Process

### Version Numbering

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Checklist

1. Update version in package.json
2. Run version synchronization: `npm run version:sync`
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with new version section
4. Verify GitHub secrets are configured: `npm run verify:github-secrets`
5. Create git tag: `git tag v{version}`
6. Push changes and tag: `git push origin main --tags`
7. Automated publishing workflow handles NPM and registry updates

### Automated Publishing (v2.5.0+)

Starting with version 2.5.0, releases are fully automated through GitHub Actions:

- **Trigger**: Push git tag with `v*` pattern (e.g., `v2.5.0`)
- **NPM Publishing**: Automatic with `NPM_TOKEN` secret
- **MCP Registry**: Automatic with GitHub OIDC authentication
- **GitHub Release**: Auto-generated with release notes

**Prerequisites**: Ensure `NPM_TOKEN` secret is configured in repository settings.

### Registry Publishing

Registry updates are automatically synchronized with NPM releases through GitHub Actions. Manual publishing can be performed using:

```bash
# Validate metadata
npm run version:validate

# Publish to NPM (required for registry validation)
npm publish

# Submit to MCP Registry (requires authentication)
mcp-publisher publish
```

For detailed publishing instructions, see the [MCP Registry Publishing Guide](https://docs.modelcontextprotocol.io/registry/publishing).
